        //Given two strings, S and T with lengths M and N, find the length of the 'Longest Common Subsequence'.
        //For a string 'str'(per se) of length K, the subsequences are the strings containing characters in the same relative order as they are present
        // in 'str,' but not necessarily contiguous. Subsequences contain all the strings of length varying from 0 to K.
        //Example :
        //Subsequences of string "abc" are:  ""(empty string), a, b, c, ab, bc, ac, abc.
