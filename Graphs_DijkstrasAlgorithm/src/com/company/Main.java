        //Input Format :
        //Line 1: Two Integers V and E (separated by space)
        //Next E lines : Three integers ei, ej and wi, denoting that there exists an edge between
        // vertex ei and vertex ej with weight wi (separated by space)

        //For each vertex, print its vertex number and its distance from source, in a separate line.
        // The vertex number and its distance needs to be separated by a single space.
